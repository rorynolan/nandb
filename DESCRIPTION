Description: This package is gives functions for calculation of molecular 
    number and brightness from images, as detailed in Digman et al. 2008. This
    is (to the best of my knowledge) the first free, open-source software 
    available for this purpose and comes with an implementation of the novel
    "automatic detrending" technique.
